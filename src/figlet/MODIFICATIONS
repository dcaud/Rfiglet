This distribution of figlet is highly modified, and is no longer
appropriate for use as a command line utility.  The original figlet
source is available here:

https://github.com/cmatsuoka/figlet

Numerous and significant changes were made to figlet.c:
  * Changed `main()` to `figlet_main()`.
  * Removed all calls to exit, fprintf, printf, and putchar.
  * Always reset optind to 1.
  * Probably other things that I don't remember.
