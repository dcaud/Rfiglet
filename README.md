What is this?
====================================================================
This is an R package providing access to printing via figlet.

This offers you:

```
> library(Rfiglet)
> figlet("Fancy Printing")
 _____                        ____       _       _   _

                      |___/                                  |___/  
```


How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley Wickham's
devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After installing that,
you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github("wrathematics/Rfiglet")

into an R terminal to install this package.
